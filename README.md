Arduino robot pointing out Mecca

This is an Arduino sketch for the official Arduino Robot, http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Robot
The robot points out the direction of Mecca.
Two images, a_intro.bmp and allah.bmp, found in the bmp-folder must be transfered to the sd-card (although a_intro is not used at the moment). Video at <http://vimeo.com/79468492>.
